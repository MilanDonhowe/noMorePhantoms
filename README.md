# No More Phantoms!
A Minecraft Datapack that removes phantoms.

## What does this datapack do?

This datapack effectively removes phantoms from the game.  Additionally, this datapack adds a new crafting recipe in order to obtain, "Phantom Membrane" the only redeeming quality of Phantoms.

The crafting recipe requires 2 bones and 2 slime balls.

## How do I use it?
Datapacks are minecraft save specific, meaning that in order to use a datapack you have to add it to each save you wish to have the datapack on.


**How to install noMorePhantoms:**
1. **Move the noMorePhantoms folder from this repository to /.minecraft/saves/(your world name here)/datapacks**

2. Restart or reload your world with `/reload`.

This also works on Minecraft Servers/Realms, just move the datapack to your datapacks folder of your minecraft world save and reload or restart the server.


## How does the databack work?

This datapack does only two things.  Every minecraft "tick" it kills all phantoms near every player on the world.  This ensures Phantoms never get a chance to do anything.

The second thing this datapack does is add a minecraft recipe which is just a json file under the "noMorePhantoms/data/remove/recipes" directory.
